This bug occurs when using the Expo's Camera API with custom image processing.  The issue arises when attempting to access pixel data from a captured image immediately after taking the picture.  The image data might not be fully available, resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes. For example, trying to get image dimensions or pixel data from the image object may return incorrect values or throw an error.
