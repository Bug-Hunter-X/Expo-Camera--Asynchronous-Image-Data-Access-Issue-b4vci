# Expo Camera Asynchronous Image Data Access Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API where attempting to access image pixel data immediately after capture can lead to incorrect or incomplete data.  This can manifest as unexpected behavior or app crashes.

## Bug Description
When using Expo's Camera API to capture an image and process its pixel data, accessing the pixel data synchronously right after the capture often results in incomplete or incorrect data. The image data may not be fully loaded or processed, leading to erroneous results.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Take a picture. Notice the incorrect processing or error message.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that image data processing occurs asynchronously, only after the image data is completely available. This is usually indicated by events provided by the Camera API.
